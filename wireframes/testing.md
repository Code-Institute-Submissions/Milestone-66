## W3C Validation 
### HTML
*index.html* and *plan-a-visit.html* were both put through the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
* ### Index
    The following errors were found and corrected

1.   
    ```
    Error: Bad value 120px for attribute height on element img: Expected a digit but saw p instead.
     From line 31, column 13; to line 31, column 131
     < img src="assets/images/hooker.png" alt="Galway Hooker, type of fishing boat home to Galway." id="hooker" height=120px >â†©     
     ```
    "height=120px" corrected to "height=120".

2. 
    ```
    Error: Element a not allowed as child of element ul in this context. (Suppressing further errors from this subtree.)
     From line 49, column 13; to line 49, column 50
     < a href="index.html" class="nav-link" >â†©     
    ```

    This same error was found for the "Plan A Visit" and "Contact" links in #mobile-nav. The "Ul" element was changed to a "nav" element.

3.  
    ```
    Error: Bad value for attribute action on element form: Must be non-empty.
     From line 68, column 10; to line 68, column 43
     â†©         < form id="contact-form" action="" >â†©    
    ```

    action="" was removed.

4.  
    ```
    Error: Stray end tag i.
     From line 73, column 98; to line 73, column 101
     lane">< /i >< /i >< /butt 
    ```

    The stray < /i > tag was removed.

5. 
    ``` 
    Error: A slash was not immediately followed by >.
     At line 153, column 17
            < br/  >â†©      
    ```  

    Several < br/ > tags written incorrectly written with a space before the closing bracket. The spaces were removed.

6. 
    ```
    Error: Stray start tag script.
     From line 159, column 73; to line 159, column 106
     ton): --> <script src="assets/js/toggle.js"></scri 
    ```
    Script tag was outside of < body >. All script tags were moved to within < body >.

7. 
    ```
    Error: Element li not allowed as child of element a in this context. (Suppressing further errors from this subtree.)
    From line 50, column 19; to line 50, column 32
          <li id="home"> <i cl 
    ```
    
    < li > elements were changed to < div > elements.

After these errors were corrected, the HTML passed without error or warning.

* ### Plan-a-visit
The following warning was found

1. 
    ```
    Warning: Consider avoiding viewport values that prevent users from resizing documents.
    rom line 20, column 7; to line 20, column 115
    pt>â†©      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=0;" />â†©   </
    ```

* A fix was found [here](https://www.webdeveloper.com/d/367195-avoid-validation-warnings-on-meta-viewport/2) and implemented.

    After this was corrected, the HTML passed without error or warning.

## CSS
All CSS was put through the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

* ### Style
    
    Located at assets/css/style.css. 
    The following errors were found and corrected.

1. 
    ```
    14  	::selection	Value Error : color none is not a color value : none
    ```

    The line was removed as it was unnecessary. 

2. 
    ```
    62	#visit	text is not a background-clip value : text
    74	#galway	text is not a background-clip value : text
    ```
    These lines were removed to satisfy the validator as they did not affect the rendering of the page.

3. 
    ```
    134	.welcome-text	Value Error : width only 0 can be a unit. You must put a unit after your number : 80
    ```
    This line was removed as it was redundant.

4. 
    ```
    140	.welcome-text	rgb(255, 255, 255, 0.6) is not a box-shadow value : rgb(255, 255, 255, 0.6)
    ```

    This line was removed as it was redundant.

5. 
    ```
    676	#menu-button	0.1 is not a animation-duration value : 0.1
    ```

    The value was corrected to be a unit in seconds.

6. 
    ```
    720	ul	Property padding-inline-start doesn't exist : 0
    ```
    This line was removed as it was redundant.

    After these fixes, the CSS passed the validator without error.

* ### Slideshow.css
    Located at assets/css/slideshow.css.
    The CSS passed the validator without error.

## JavaScript
* The following files in assets/js/ were passed through [JSHint](https://jshint.com/):

* todoList.js
* toggle.js
* map.js

    Warnings included use of template literals for compatibility reasons. A developer decision was made to continue using template literals as they are supported by most browsers and are common JavaScript developer practice. 
    Warnings about undefined/unused variables are to be ignored; they may be undefined/unused within the context of the individual script, but they are defined/used by an external script. (ie. map.js calls the variable "map", which is not defined within map.js but is used by the external Google Maps JavaScript API.)
