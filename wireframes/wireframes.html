<img src="map-wireframe.png">
<p>Wireframe showing the map on "Plan A Visit" page. The menu to the left consists of buttons for each category.
    When a button is clicked, markers are loaded to the map. When a marker is clicked, an info-window appears on the marker.
    The info-window contains the marker's name, some basic information, a link to a website related to the marker (not shown in wireframe), and "Save Location" button. 
    (This button has been renamed to "Add to List" in the release). When this button is clicked, a list-item is created in the
    "Saved Locations" list (renamed to "Saved Places" in the release) containing the marker's name.
    The list item can be deleted by clicking the delete/trash-can icon next to it.
